# Kitchen Items

- Tongs
- Some containers to hold dry/wet dredge
- Parchment
- Paper towel

# Preparation
- Butterfly protein and pound with a pot or tenderizer (to approx1-1.5cm thickness)
	- Tip: place protein between plastic wrap
- In seperate bowls/pans (flatish container prefered) pour out panko and all purpose flour
- Crack eggs into a bowl and whisk with 1 tbsp water

	- Pour approx 0.5-1cm of oil into pan and heat to medium-high
	- Slowly place protein into oil (do 1 at a time, max 2)
		- Tip: place it so it drops away from you, this will prevent oil from splashing towards you
	- Cook protein on each side for 3-5mins, watching for browness
- To **air fry**:
	- Place one layer of protein into bottom of air fryer
	- Give the top a light spray/dab of oil
	- Cook at 350F for 9mins
	- Flip and repeat
- Place on a wire rack or some paper towel to let rest and collect oil
